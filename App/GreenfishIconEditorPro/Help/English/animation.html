How to...

<center><h1>Create an animated cursor or GIF animation</h1></center>

<span class="r">Browse the <em>Samples</em> folder for example animations.</span><p>

When creating an animation, document pages correspond to movie frames, so your only task is to set a frame duration to all the pages.<p>

This can be done by choosing <em>Icon|Page properties</em> or double-clicking the concerned page. The edit box labeled <em>Frame duration</em> contains the duration value for the selected frame, which has an initial value of zero milliseconds (no animation). Choose <em>Icon|Apply frame duration to all frames</em> to set the same duration for all frames - the duration value which is currently set for the selected page.<p>

<span class="r">Please note that you may experience round-off errors when saving and reloading an animation file. Animated cursors use the jiffy as units (1/60 second), while, in GIF files, the duration must be an integral multiple of 1/100 s. Thus a duration value of 143 is loaded back as 150 (ANI) or 140 (GIF).</span><p>

<h2>Designing animated cursors</h2><p>

<span class="r">It is recommended to read <a href="cursor.html">this</a> article about static cursors first.</span><p>

When designing an animated cursor, there is an additional thing you should set. The <em>hot spot</em> must be chosen for each individual page. Different frames may have different hot spots, so it is not enough to set the hot spot only for the first frame.<p>

<h2>Testing your animation</h2><p>
