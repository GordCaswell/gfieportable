It may be surprising but .ICO (Windows icon) and .CUR (Windows cursor) files are very-very similar. (This means that cursors may also have multiple pages which may also be PNG-compressed, but this scarcely occurs.) The only difference is that, considering a cursor, all pages must have a so-called <em>hot spot</em> which is a special pixel marking the spot where mouse events occur. For example, this is the tip of an arrow, the tip of the pointing finger of a hand cursor or just the middle of an I-beam (text cursor). This pixel can be specified using the <em>Hot spot (H)</em> tool.<p>

Usually, Windows cursors have no more than <em>one</em> page which is <em>32 x 32</em> pixels large and may be of arbitrary color depth. The <em>inverted</em> color is widely used - it allows the pointer to be visible over almost all screen images.<p>

So let's summarize the most important characteristics of Windows cursors:<p>

<ul>
	<li>One page with 32 x 32 pixels</li>
	<li>Hot spot specified</li>
	<li>Optional use of the inverted color</li>
</ul>

<span class="h">Open <em>select.cur</em> from the Samples folder in order to see an example - that cursor was extracted from GFIE itself.</span><p>
